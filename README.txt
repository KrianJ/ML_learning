# directory explanation

# matlab_2_python: transfer sparse subspace clustering algorithm into python style, which coded on matlab by my tutor LaiWei

# ML:
    > algorithm: Basic machine learning algorithm implementation based on what i learned during my postgraduate time.
    > datasets: Applied in algorithm directory & code unit test sometimes.
    > tools: Used in data pre-processing like standard, matrix decomposition stuff.(unfinished though...lol)

# NLP: A nature language process project, text classifying, based on tf-idf algorithm and improved tf-idf algorithm.
    which belongs to my NLP final assignment.

# PR: Pattern Recognition projects. learned from class and try to implement them by python. They all works by using the training_set
    directory's datasets.


All the works mentioned above still being improved when time available.
